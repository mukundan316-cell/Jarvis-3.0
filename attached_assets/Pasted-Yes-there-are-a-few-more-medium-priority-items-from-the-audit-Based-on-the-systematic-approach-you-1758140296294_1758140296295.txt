Yes, there are a few more medium priority items from the audit. Based on the systematic approach you've been taking, here's the next prompt:

```
CONSOLIDATE DUPLICATE COMMAND CENTER COMPONENTS - Following replit.md guidelines, eliminate duplicate command center implementations (JarvisCommandCenter.tsx, JarvisCommandCenterFixed.tsx, JarvisCommandCenterOriginal.tsx) and retain single unified command center component.

Part 1: Question Deconstruction
UNDERSTAND: Three command center components exist with overlapping functionality creating maintenance burden
ANALYZE: JarvisCommandCenter.tsx, JarvisCommandCenterFixed.tsx, JarvisCommandCenterOriginal.tsx represent multiple iterations/fixes of same component
REASON: Multiple command center versions violate DRY principle and create confusion about which version is authoritative
SYNTHESIZE: Single command center component incorporating best features from all versions
CONCLUDE: One reliable command center component with clear functionality and proper integration

Part 2: Component Consolidation Strategy

**AUDIT EXISTING IMPLEMENTATIONS:**
- Compare functionality across all three command center components
- Identify which version has most complete/stable implementation
- Document unique features or bug fixes in each version
- Assess integration points and usage throughout application

**CHOOSE AUTHORITATIVE VERSION:**
- Select most feature-complete and stable implementation as base
- Migrate any unique functionality from other versions
- Ensure all existing integrations continue to work
- Maintain backward compatibility for existing workflows

**REMOVE DUPLICATES:**
- Delete redundant command center files
- Update all imports and component references
- Test that command center functionality works across all personas
- Verify no broken dependencies or missing features

Part 3: Success Criteria

**SINGLE COMMAND CENTER:**
- Only one command center component exists in codebase
- All command center functionality consolidated into unified component
- Clear component naming without version suffixes
- All personas can access command center features properly

**FUNCTIONAL VALIDATION:**
- Command processing works for Rachel, Admin, and John personas
- Voice commands integrate properly with consolidated component
- Agent execution triggers correctly from command center
- No regression in existing command center capabilities

Consolidate command center components to eliminate version confusion and maintenance overhead.
```

After this, the remaining medium priority items would be:
- Consolidate metrics components (EnhancedDashboardKpis vs UnifiedDashboardMetrics)
- Remove hardcoded test data configurations

Then the low priority cleanup items for naming conventions and database constraints.
