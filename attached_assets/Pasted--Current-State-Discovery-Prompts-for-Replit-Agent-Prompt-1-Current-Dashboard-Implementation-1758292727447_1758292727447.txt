🔍 Current State Discovery Prompts for Replit Agent
Prompt 1: Current Dashboard Implementation
Can you show me the current implementation of the JARVIS Admin dashboard? Specifically:
1. What metrics are currently displayed in EnhancedDashboard.tsx?
2. How is UniversalDashboardMetrics.tsx structured?
3. What data sources feed these metrics (ConfigService, database tables, hardcoded)?
Prompt 2: Existing KPI Configuration
What KPIs are currently configured for JARVIS Admin persona:
1. Are there any existing business metrics in the dashboardKpis table?
2. What's in the current ConfigService for admin-specific metrics?
3. Show me the structure of the kpiConfig if it exists.
Prompt 3: Agent Hierarchy Current State
How is the Agent Hierarchy currently implemented:
1. What's the data structure for the 6-layer architecture?
2. How are agents mapped to layers in the database?
3. Is there any existing business context or categorization?
4. Show me the AgentHierarchy.tsx component structure.
Prompt 4: Persona Configuration
How are personas currently managed:
1. What persona-specific configurations exist for JARVIS Admin?
2. Is there existing view/display preference storage?
3. How does userPreferences table handle admin settings?
4. Any existing role-based UI variations?
Prompt 5: Command Center Implementation
What's the current JARVIS Command Center implementation:
1. What metrics are displayed (Processing Power, Memory, Users, Success Rate)?
2. How are these metrics calculated or sourced?
3. Is there any existing business context in the Command Center?
4. Show the JarvisCommandCenter.tsx component if it exists.
Prompt 6: ConfigService Capabilities
What ConfigService entries currently exist for:
1. Dashboard configuration (dashboard.config)?
2. Metric definitions (metrics.config)?
3. Persona-specific settings (admin.config)?
4. Any existing view or display mode configurations?
Prompt 7: Database Schema for Metrics
What tables currently store metric/KPI data:
1. Structure of dashboardKpis table?
2. Any business metrics tables (claims, underwriting, revenue)?
3. How are agent execution metrics stored?
4. Any existing industry benchmark data?
Prompt 8: Existing Business Logic
Is there any existing business/insurance logic implemented:
1. Claims processing metrics calculation?
2. Underwriting efficiency measurements?
3. Revenue or cost tracking?
4. Combined ratio or other insurance KPIs?
Prompt 9: Current UI Components
What universal components exist that could be extended:
1. Is there a UniversalToggle or view switcher component?
2. Any existing card components for metrics display?
3. How is the header/navigation structured for adding controls?
4. Any existing tooltip or info overlay systems?
Prompt 10: Activity & Monitoring
How is current activity tracked:
1. What's logged in the activities table for admin actions?

Prompt 12: Data Flow Architecture
How does data flow to the admin dashboard:
1. API endpoints serving admin metrics?
2. Real-time updates via WebSocket?
3. Caching or performance optimization?
4. How often do metrics refresh?
Should I ask these prompts one by one to get the current state, or would you like to provide answers to help me understand what's already implemented?

Once we have this baseline understanding, I can provide enhancement recommendations that properly extend the existing architecture rather than making assumptions about what needs to be built.
