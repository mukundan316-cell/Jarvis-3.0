Questions for Replit Agent About Workflow Progression
HITL to Next Step Transition:
How should Rachel progress from HITL review to Step 2 (Intelligent Ingestion)?
- When she approves/overrides in the HITL modal, does this automatically trigger Step 2?
- Should the "2 emails successfully auto-processed and ready for next workflow step" action item be the trigger for the 8-step workflow?
- Where is the "Start 8-Step Underwriting Process" action that would begin the sequential popup workflow?
Action Item Duplication Issue:
There are duplicate/overlapping action items:
- "Review 13 emails that failed automatic processing" (opens existing email review popup)
- "Review field corrections for Willis submission" (HITL task)
- "2 emails successfully auto-processed and ready for next workflow step" (progression indicator)

How should these be consolidated for clear user experience?
- Should the individual HITL tasks replace the general "Review Failed Emails"?
- How does Rachel know which action progresses the workflow vs just reviews individual items?
Workflow State Management:
When emails are processed through Step 1 (Email Capture), what triggers the transition to Step 2?
- Should successful email processing automatically create "Begin Step 2: Intelligent Ingestion" action items?
- How are processed emails converted to submissions that enter the 8-step workflow?
- Where does Rachel see "Start Underwriting Process for [Broker Submission]" actions?
Expected User Experience Fix:
The ideal flow should be:
1. Rachel clicks "Review field corrections for Willis submission" → HITL modal opens
2. She approves/corrects the data → HITL completes
3. System creates "Begin underwriting for Willis submission" action item
4. Rachel clicks that → Step 1 popup opens showing 6-layer email processing
5. Step 1 completes → Step 2 popup auto-opens showing ingestion processing
6. Continue through all 8 steps with 6-layer visibility

Is this workflow progression currently implemented?
The core issue is that HITL completion isn't triggering the next workflow step creation. We need clear action items that progress the workflow forward rather than just reviewing individual components.
