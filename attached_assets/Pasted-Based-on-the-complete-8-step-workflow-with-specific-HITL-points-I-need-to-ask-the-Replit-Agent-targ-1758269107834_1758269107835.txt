Based on the complete 8-step workflow with specific HITL points, I need to ask the Replit Agent targeted questions about how these human intervention points are currently implemented:

## Specific HITL Questions for Replit Agent

**1. Step 2 HITL - Field Mapping Correction:**
```
Is the "UW Fix & Learn" workbench mentioned in exception flows currently implemented?
- How does Rachel correct field mappings when parsing confidence is low?
- Where is the UI for field mapping corrections?
- How are corrected fields stored as "parser hints" for learning?
- Does the system pause Step 2 execution waiting for human field validation?
```

**2. Step 5 HITL - Appetite Decision Override:**
```
How are UW overrides currently handled in the triage decision process?
- Can Rachel override Green/Yellow/Red appetite decisions in the existing system?
- Where does she provide the "required rationale" for overrides?
- How are override decisions "logged to Ledger" - what table/format?
- Does the UniversalAgentExecutionPopup show override options during Step 5?
```

**3. Step 7 HITL - Underwriting Decisions:**
```
What exists for the "required HITL at bind, declines, and wording exceptions"?
- How does Rachel review and approve quotes before binding?
- Where are decline rationales captured and stored?
- What UI exists for wording exception reviews?
- How does the "maker-checker" approval flow work currently?
```

**4. Exception Flow HITL Integration:**
```
Are these exception handling UIs currently implemented:
- "Route to UW Fix & Learn UI" for low parse confidence
- "Fall back to deterministic rules + HITL" for model uncertainty  
- "Manual rating task" for rating failures
- How do these integrate with the 6-layer architecture display?
```

**5. Workflow State Management for HITL:**
```
What workflow states exist for human intervention points?
- Is there "pending_human_review", "awaiting_override", "human_validation_required"?
- How does the commercial_property_workflows table track HITL states?
- When execution pauses for human input, how is this displayed in UniversalAgentExecutionPopup?
```

**6. Human-AI Partnership Display:**
```
In the current UniversalAgentExecutionPopup 6-layer view:
- How are HITL decision points shown within the layer execution?
- Can the popup display "AI Recommendation" + "Human Decision" side-by-side?
- How are human approval/rejection actions integrated into the execution timeline?
- Does it show when workflow is paused waiting for Rachel's input?
```

**7. Decision Ledger and Audit Trail:**
```
How are human decisions currently tracked in the Decision Ledger?
- What's captured when Rachel overrides AI recommendations?
- How are "inputs, prompts, tool calls, outputs, approvals, versions" stored?
- Where is the audit trail for human-AI collaboration decisions?
- How does this integrate with the existing agentExecutionSteps table?
```

**8. Cross-Step HITL Coordination:**
```
How does human context carry forward across the 8 steps?
- If Rachel makes corrections in Step 2, how do they affect Steps 3-8?
- Are human preferences/overrides persistent across the workflow?
- How does the system learn from Rachel's decisions to improve future automation?
```

**9. Morning Briefing HITL Integration:**
```
How are pending HITL tasks currently shown in Rachel's morning briefing?
- Are items awaiting her review/approval displayed in action items?
- How does she know when workflows are paused waiting for her input?
- What's the connection between HITL tasks and the submission queue?
```

These answers will help determine what HITL infrastructure already exists versus what needs to be built, ensuring we leverage existing patterns rather than creating duplicate or conflicting functionality.
