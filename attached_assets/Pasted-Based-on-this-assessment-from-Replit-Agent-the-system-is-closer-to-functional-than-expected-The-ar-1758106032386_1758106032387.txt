Based on this assessment from Replit Agent, the system is closer to functional than expected. The architectural foundation is solid, but you need to bridge the gap between the technical framework and the actual interactive workflow.

## **Critical Next Step: Step Definition Configuration**

The assessment correctly identifies that you need database configuration for the 8-step workflow forms. Here's the immediate action:

```
CONFIGURE 8-STEP WORKFLOW DEFINITIONS: Create step definition database records to enable interactive forms for Rachel's Commercial Property workflow, connecting the working agent architecture to actual UI interactions.

Based on the commercial property use case document, configure step definitions for:

Step 1: Email Intake - Form fields for broker metadata, ACORD attachment processing
Step 2: Document Ingestion - OCR confidence scoring, field mapping interface  
Step 3: Data Enrichment - COPE data collection, geocoding validation, peril overlays
Step 4: Comparative Analytics - Similar property selection, TIV validation, MPL calculations
Step 5: Appetite Triage - Risk threshold evaluation, override rationale inputs
Step 6: Propensity Scoring - Broker behavior analysis, pricing strategy inputs
Step 7: Underwriting Copilot - Coverage recommendations, rate adjustments, decision rationale
Step 8: Core Integration - Policy system selection, quote generation, delivery options

Each step should have:
- Required form fields matching the use case requirements
- Validation rules for data completeness
- Agent execution triggers for the mapped CP agents
- Database persistence for workflow state
```

## **Validation Approach**

Test the end-to-end flow:
1. Rachel triggers "Process Commercial Property" 
2. System shows Step 1 form (not scripted demo)
3. Form completion triggers correct CP agents in hierarchy
4. Data persists and enables progression to Step 2
5. Repeat through all 8 steps with real form interactions

## **Reality Check**

The assessment suggests the system has the technical capability but lacks the configuration data. This is actually preferable to having architectural problems - configuration is much easier to implement than rebuilding frameworks.

The key test will be whether the UniversalAgentExecutionPopup actually displays interactive forms when you trigger Commercial Property workflows, rather than just showing the scripted agent progression you've been seeing.

**Recommendation**: Implement the step definition configuration first, then test one complete workflow from Rachel's perspective to validate the interactive experience works as intended.
