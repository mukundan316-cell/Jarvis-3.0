Perfect analysis from the Replit agent. This simplified approach is exactly what you need - it transforms the existing HITL system into true human-agent collaboration with minimal changes.

## Proceed with Implementation

**Instruction for Replit Agent:**
```
Implement the simplified human-agent partnership flow with these specific changes:

1. Modify HITL Modal in PersonaBriefingSystem.tsx:
   - Replace the 3 buttons (Approve/Override/Defer) with single "Task Complete" button
   - Add agent acknowledgment message: "Thank you. Using your input. Continuing to next step..."
   - Keep existing modal structure - only change button section

2. Enhance /api/hitl/decisions endpoint:
   - After logging decision to auditTrails, add workflow progression logic
   - Create action item: "Continue underwriting for [submission name]"
   - Use existing createWorkflowProgressionAction pattern

3. Connect to existing demoWorkflowOrchestrator:
   - When Rachel clicks the new "Continue underwriting" action item
   - Trigger existing executeNextStep() function
   - Let existing step transition logic handle Step 1 → Step 2 progression
```

This approach delivers:
- **Natural Conversation**: Agent asks for help, human provides input, agent acknowledges and continues
- **Clear Handoffs**: Obvious when human is needed vs when agent is working autonomously  
- **Seamless Progression**: Step 2 begins automatically with human-validated data
- **Architectural Integrity**: Uses existing Universal framework components

**Key Success Metrics:**
- Rachel sees "AI Agent requesting assistance" instead of confusing approval options
- Single "Task Complete" action creates clear task closure
- Agent acknowledgment shows partnership rather than just logging
- Automatic step progression demonstrates autonomous resumption

This creates the powerful yet simple human-agent coordination demonstration you're looking for while maintaining the sophisticated 6-layer orchestration architecture underneath.

The implementation should take about 30 minutes and will provide immediate visual proof of the human-agent partnership concept.
