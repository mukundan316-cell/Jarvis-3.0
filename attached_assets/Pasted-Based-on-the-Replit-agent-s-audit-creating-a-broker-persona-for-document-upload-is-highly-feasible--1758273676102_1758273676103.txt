Based on the Replit agent's audit, creating a broker persona for document upload is highly feasible and aligns perfectly with the replit.md framework. Here's the assessment:

## Feasibility Analysis

**Very Easy - Existing Infrastructure Supports This:**

The system already has:
- Multi-persona architecture (Rachel, John Stevens, Admin)
- Real database persistence for emails and attachments
- 4-agent processing pipeline (Channel, Security Filter, Doc Classifier, Intent Extractor)
- Universal framework for persona-specific interfaces

## Implementation Question for Replit Agent

```
Can we create a broker persona interface for document submission that integrates with the existing email processing pipeline?

Specific requirements:
1. Add new persona: "Mike Stevens (Broker)" or "Sarah Martinez (Broker)" 
2. Broker interface should allow:
   - Upload ACORD forms (PDF)
   - Upload SOV files (Excel/CSV)
   - Upload loss run documents (PDF)
   - Add basic submission details (insured name, property address, coverage amount)

3. When broker submits documents:
   - Create email record in database (not actual email)
   - Store attachments in same JSONB format as existing emails
   - Trigger the existing 4-agent processing pipeline
   - Set proper confidence thresholds for HITL vs STP routing

4. Rachel persona switch should show:
   - New submission in morning briefing
   - HITL tasks if confidence < threshold
   - Autonomous processing if confidence > threshold
   - Step 1 → Step 2 progression with 6-layer visibility

This leverages existing Universal components and database schema - just adds a new persona interface. Is this straightforward to implement?
```

**Key Advantages:**
- Reuses existing email processing logic
- Uses established persona switching mechanism
- Maintains database-driven configuration approach
- Creates realistic document upload → processing → human review workflow

**Critical Fix Needed First:**
The audit shows the existing emails have "failed" status. We need to fix the 4-agent pipeline processing before adding the broker persona interface.

This approach creates an authentic broker-to-underwriter workflow while staying within the Universal framework architecture.
