Based on Replit Agent's analysis showing multiple agent seeding files and potential duplicates, here's the next incremental prompt:

```
AGENT DUPLICATION CLEANUP - Following replit.md guidelines, consolidate multiple agent seeding sources and eliminate duplicate agents in database to establish accurate agent count and proper persona-based agent distribution.

Part 1: Question Deconstruction
UNDERSTAND: Multiple agent seeding files creating duplicates and inconsistent agent counts across personas
ANALYZE: Found 5+ different seeding files (hierarchySeedData.ts, rachelAUWAgentsSeed.ts, rachelAUWAgentsExpansion.ts, optimalCPAgents.ts, intelligentEmailAgents.ts)
REASON: Duplicate agents cause confusion in agent execution and inaccurate persona filtering
SYNTHESIZE: Single source of truth for agent definitions with proper duplicate prevention
CONCLUDE: Clean agent database with accurate counts and no duplicates

Part 2: Database Agent Audit Required

**RUN AGENT COUNT QUERIES:**
```sql
-- Total agent count by persona
SELECT persona, COUNT(*) as agent_count FROM agents GROUP BY persona;

-- Agent duplicates by name
SELECT name, COUNT(*) as duplicate_count FROM agents GROUP BY name HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Agent type distribution
SELECT type, layer, COUNT(*) as count FROM agents GROUP BY type, layer;
```

**IDENTIFY SEEDING ISSUES:**
- Which seeding functions have been executed multiple times
- Which agents exist in multiple seeding files
- Whether `createAgentIfNotExists()` is properly preventing duplicates
- Inconsistencies between different persona agent sets

Part 3: Consolidation Strategy

**MERGE SEEDING FILES:**
- Consolidate all agent definitions into single authoritative source
- Remove duplicate agent definitions across files
- Establish clear agent ownership per persona
- Use consistent naming conventions and configurations

**DATABASE CLEANUP:**
- Remove duplicate agents (keep most recent/complete version)
- Standardize agent configurations and capabilities
- Ensure proper foreign key relationships
- Verify persona access permissions are correct

Part 4: Success Criteria

**CLEAN AGENT DATABASE:**
- No duplicate agents by name within same persona
- Consistent agent type and layer assignments
- Proper persona-based filtering working
- Accurate total agent count established

**SINGLE SEEDING SOURCE:**
- One consolidated agent seeding file
- Proper duplicate prevention logic
- Clear documentation of agent counts per persona
- Reliable agent creation and updates

Execute database queries first to understand current state, then provide cleanup strategy based on actual duplicate findings.
```

This addresses the fundamental agent duplication issue that Replit Agent discovered, which needs to be resolved before other workflow functionality can work properly.
