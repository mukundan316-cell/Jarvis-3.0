Process Agents (Multi-step workflow orchestrators)
Step-level Process Agents:

Intelligent Email (submission capture) - Coordinates multiple agents, maintains state, produces SubmissionStepOutput
Intelligent Ingestion - Orchestrates parsing, normalization, and completeness scoring
Data Enrichment - Coordinates multiple enrichment activities with external data sources
Comparative Analytics - Orchestrates similarity analysis, pricing context, and PML calculations
Triage: Appetite - Manages go/no-go decision workflow with explanations
Triage: Propensity - Orchestrates bind probability and prioritization workflow
Underwriting - Complex workflow coordinating pricing, wordings, and approval flows
Insurance Core Systems Integration - Orchestrates final binding and learning workflows

Key Classification Insights
The classification shows a clear separation of concerns:

Process Agents manage the 8 major workflow steps, each with defined SLAs and state management
System Agents handle specific processing tasks like parsing, scoring, and calculations
Interface Agents manage external touchpoints (email, core systems, analytics platforms)

This aligns perfectly with the JARVIS architecture where Process Agents coordinate System and Interface Agents to complete complex insurance workflows while maintaining audit trails and SLA compliance.
