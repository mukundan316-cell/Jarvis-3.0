I need a complete assessment of the current system state to implement the Commercial Property 8-step workflow MDP. Please provide detailed answers to these questions:

1. WORKFLOW EXECUTION INFRASTRUCTURE:
- How does the current processCommand function handle multi-step workflows?
- Does commercialPropertyWorkflows table track step progression? Show the current schema
- Can the system execute steps sequentially (1→2→3) automatically?
- How are step transitions currently handled?

2. HIERARCHICAL POPUP CURRENT STATE:
- Show the complete UniversalAgentExecutionPopup component code
- How does it currently populate the 6 layers?
- Does it support showing different agents for different steps?
- Can it display parallel agent execution within a layer?
- Does it update in real-time during execution?

3. AGENT EXECUTION REALITY:
- Which agents currently exist in the agents table for Commercial Property?
- Are there system prompts defined for any agents?
- Does any agent actually call OpenAI/LLM or all mocked?
- Show example of current agentExecution object structure
- How is agent selection currently done (hardcoded vs rules-based)?

4. RACHEL'S CURRENT CAPABILITIES:
- Can Rachel upload ACORD forms now? Show the upload handling
- Does document parsing extract any real data or return mock?
- Are there UI components for: risk assessment display, quote viewing, evidence book?
- How does Rachel trigger workflow execution currently?
- What happens when Rachel clicks "Process Submission"?

5. DATA PERSISTENCE FOR 8 STEPS:
- Which tables exist for storing outputs of each step:
  * Step 1: Email intake - where stored?
  * Step 2: Parsed ACORD data - where stored?
  * Step 3: Enrichment data - where stored?
  * Step 4: Comparative analytics - where stored?
  * Step 5: Triage decision - where stored?
  * Step 6: Propensity score - where stored?
  * Step 7: Quote data - quotes table exists?
  * Step 8: Integration logs - where stored?

6. ADMIN CONFIGURATION CAPABILITIES:
- Can Admin create/edit agent system prompts through UI?
- Are agent selection rules configurable or hardcoded?
- Can Admin define workflow steps through UI?
- Show current Admin agent management UI capabilities

7. MISSING COMPONENTS FOR 8-STEP WORKFLOW:
- Which of these components exist vs need creation:
  * Evidence Book viewer
  * Decision Ledger display
  * Workflow step navigator
  * Risk assessment dashboard
  * Quote comparison view
  * KPI tracking per step

8. UNIVERSAL COMPONENT PATTERNS:
- Show how Universal components handle persona-specific behavior
- How do they communicate with backend (REST, WebSocket)?
- Are there reusable patterns for: progress tracking, data tables, file uploads?
- How is real-time update handled in existing components?

9. CURRENT BLOCKERS:
- What's preventing real AI execution today?
- Are there WebSocket connections set up?
- Do we have OpenAI API integration code anywhere?
- What's the biggest technical gap for the 8-step workflow?

Please provide code snippets and specific file locations where relevant. This assessment will help create precise incremental prompts that build on existing infrastructure rather than duplicating work.
