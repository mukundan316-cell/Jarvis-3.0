Based on the Replit agent's analysis, the core issue is missing workflow progression after HITL completion. Here's how to create a simple but powerful human-agent coordination demonstration:

## Simple Human-Agent Partnership Flow

**Ideal Sequence:**
1. **Agent Requests Help**: "I extracted property value as $15M with 65% confidence. Can you verify this from the ACORD form?"
2. **Human Reviews & Decides**: Rachel sees the form, confirms/corrects, clicks "Task Complete"
3. **Agent Acknowledges & Continues**: "Thank you. Using corrected value $12M. Proceeding to data enrichment."
4. **Autonomous Progression**: Step 2 automatically begins with human-validated data

## Implementation Instructions for Replit Agent

**Simple 3-Part Fix:**

```
1. Enhance HITL Modal with Clear Task Completion:
   - Show: "AI Agent requesting human assistance"
   - Display: Side-by-side comparison (AI extraction vs source document)
   - Action: Single "Task Complete" button (not Approve/Override/Defer)
   - Result: Clear handoff back to agent

2. Add Agent Acknowledgment:
   - After human clicks "Task Complete": Show brief agent response
   - Display: "Task received. Continuing with validated data."
   - Visual: Progress indicator showing agent resuming work
   - Action: Automatic progression to next step after 2-second delay

3. Fix Workflow Progression Logic:
   - In /api/hitl/decisions endpoint: After logging decision, create next workflow action
   - Create action item: "Continue underwriting for [Submission Name]"
   - Auto-trigger: Begin Step 2 when Rachel clicks the continuation action
```

**Simplified User Experience:**
```
Step 1: Agent processes email → encounters uncertainty → "Human assistance needed"
Step 2: Rachel reviews → provides input → clicks "Task Complete"  
Step 3: Agent confirms → "Thank you, continuing" → Step 2 begins automatically
Result: Clear handoff pattern that can be repeated throughout 8-step workflow
```

**Key Design Principles:**
- **Single Action**: One "Task Complete" button instead of multiple confusing options
- **Clear Communication**: Agent explicitly requests help and acknowledges completion
- **Autonomous Resumption**: Agent takes control back immediately after human input
- **Visual Continuity**: Same popup shows agent requesting → human responding → agent continuing

This creates a natural conversation between Rachel and the AI system, demonstrating true partnership where each party handles what they do best.

**Should the Replit agent implement this simplified human-agent handoff pattern?**
