🎯 Primary Goal Completed
Successfully transformed JARVIS IntelliAgent 3.0's agent CRUD system from hardcoded configurations to a fully metadata-driven approach using ConfigService, eliminating all hardcoded arrays and making the system database-driven.

🔧 Key Technical Fixes Applied
Resolved Authentication Issues

Fixed 401 Unauthorized errors by adding credentials: 'include' to all ConfigService API calls
Ensured proper session handling across all agent configuration requests
Enhanced ConfigService Integration

Updated useAgentConfig.ts hooks with proper error handling and fallback data
Added automatic seeding functionality that runs on server startup
Created temporary seeding button for testing/verification
Converted All Agent CRUD Components

AgentFactory.tsx: Replaced hardcoded layer definitions with ConfigService calls
CreateNewAgentModal.tsx: Dynamic form fields now populate from database
EditAgentModal.tsx: Edit functionality uses metadata-driven options
✅ Verification & Testing
Architect Review: Confirmed the metadata-driven system meets all requirements with no security issues
Live Testing: Agent Directory now displays 50 agents with full metadata (performance metrics, collaboration status, governance profiles)
ConfigService Validation: All dropdown options (layers, types, capabilities, personas) now pull from database instead of hardcoded arrays
🏗️ Architecture Impact
NO HARD-CODING Principle: Fully aligned with replit.md standards - all business logic is now database-driven
Multi-Tenant Support: ConfigService scope precedence working (persona → agentId → workflowId → global)
6-Layer Agent Architecture: All layer definitions, types, and relationships now stored in ConfigService
"Lego Block" Components: Universal components can now be configured entirely through database metadata
The system has successfully moved from static configurations to a dynamic, database-driven approach that supports the full agent lifecycle management across the 6-layer hierarchy with proper multi-tenant capabilities.
