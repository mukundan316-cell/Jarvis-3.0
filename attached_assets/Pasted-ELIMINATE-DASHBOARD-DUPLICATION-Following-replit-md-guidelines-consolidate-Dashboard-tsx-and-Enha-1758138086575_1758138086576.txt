ELIMINATE DASHBOARD DUPLICATION - Following replit.md guidelines, consolidate Dashboard.tsx and EnhancedDashboard.tsx into single unified dashboard component to eliminate code duplication and maintain clean architecture.

Part 1: Question Deconstruction
UNDERSTAND: Two dashboard components exist with duplicate functionality requiring consolidation
ANALYZE: Dashboard.tsx vs EnhancedDashboard.tsx creating maintenance burden and architectural violation
REASON: Code duplication violates replit.md "Lego block" principles and creates inconsistent user experience
SYNTHESIZE: Single unified dashboard serving all personas with proper configuration-driven behavior
CONCLUDE: One dashboard component with persona-specific customization through props/database config

Part 2: Dashboard Consolidation Strategy

**AUDIT CURRENT IMPLEMENTATIONS:**
- Compare functionality between Dashboard.tsx and EnhancedDashboard.tsx
- Identify unique features in each component
- Determine which component has more complete/modern implementation
- Assess integration with existing routing and persona switching

**CONSOLIDATION APPROACH:**
- Keep the more feature-complete dashboard as base
- Migrate unique functionality from the other dashboard
- Ensure persona-specific customization works through props
- Maintain all existing functionality during consolidation

**REMOVE DUPLICATE:**
- Delete the redundant dashboard file
- Update all imports and routing references
- Test that all persona workflows still function
- Verify no functionality is lost in consolidation

Part 3: Success Criteria

**SINGLE DASHBOARD COMPONENT:**
- Only one dashboard component exists in codebase
- All personas (Rachel, Admin, John) use same component
- Persona-specific behavior driven by props/database config
- No functionality lost from either original dashboard

**PROPER INTEGRATION:**
- Routing updated to use unified dashboard
- All persona switching works correctly
- Dashboard metrics and KPIs display properly for each persona
- No broken imports or references remain

Consolidate dashboards to eliminate critical code duplication while preserving all functionality.
