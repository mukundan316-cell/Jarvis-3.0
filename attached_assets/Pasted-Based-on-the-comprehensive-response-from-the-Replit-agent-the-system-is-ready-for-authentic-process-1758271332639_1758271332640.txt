Based on the comprehensive response from the Replit agent, the system is ready for authentic processing. However, I need to ensure the Universal Agent Framework's 6-layer hierarchy is properly maintained across the 8-step transition.

## Critical Questions for Replit Agent About 6-Layer Continuity

**Step 1 to Step 2 Transition:**
```
When Step 1 (Intelligent Email Capture) completes and transitions to Step 2 (Intelligent Ingestion), how is the 6-layer execution maintained?
- Does each step open a new UniversalAgentExecutionPopup showing its specific 6-layer view?
- How is execution context passed between steps while preserving layer visibility?
- Can Rachel see the continuous 6-layer orchestration across the entire 8-step workflow?
```

**Layer-Specific Agent Mapping:**
```
For the transition from Step 1 to Step 2, confirm the 6-layer agent assignments:

Step 1 (Email Capture):
- Experience Layer: ABC Insurance configuration
- Meta Brain Layer: Email workflow orchestration  
- Role Layer: Rachel Thompson AUW context
- Process Layer: Intelligent Email Agent
- System Layer: Channel Agent → Security Filter → Doc Classifier → Intent Extractor
- Interface Layer: Email monitoring, attachment processing

Step 2 (Intelligent Ingestion):
- Experience Layer: [same ABC Insurance]
- Meta Brain Layer: [workflow progression logic]
- Role Layer: [same Rachel context]
- Process Layer: Intelligent Ingestion Agent  
- System Layer: Parsing Agent → Schema Normalizer → Completeness Scorer
- Interface Layer: Form Recognizer API, OCR services

Is this layer mapping correctly implemented for seamless transition?
```

**Workflow Orchestration Continuity:**
```
How does the demoWorkflowOrchestrator maintain 6-layer visibility across steps?
- When Step 1 completes, does Step 2 automatically open with its own 6-layer popup?
- Is the workflow execution ID preserved across all 8 steps?
- Can Rachel see which layer is active at any given moment during multi-step processing?
```

**HITL Integration Across Layers:**
```
When HITL intervention is needed (like the 65% confidence field correction):
- Which layer displays the human intervention point in the UniversalAgentExecutionPopup?
- How does human input affect the layer execution flow?
- Is Rachel's decision logged at the appropriate layer level for audit purposes?
```

**Execution Trigger for Authentic Processing:**
```
To trigger the authentic workflow with real ACORD documents:
- Should I execute POST /api/emails/auto-process-broker-emails to process Riverside Manufacturing and Pacific Coast Warehouse?
- Will this create the complete 8-step workflow with proper 6-layer visualization throughout?
- How will the transition from Step 1 completion to Step 2 initiation be displayed to Rachel?
```

The goal is maintaining architectural integrity - each step should show its specific 6-layer execution while providing seamless workflow continuity for Rachel's experience.
