Please provide a comprehensive audit of the JARVIS Admin dual-view implementation. Check and report on the following:

## 1. ConfigService Entries
Show me all config entries added for dual-view functionality:
- Does 'dual-view-enabled.config' exist? What's its current value?
- Does 'view-mode.config' exist? Show the full configuration
- Does 'business-terminology.config' exist? Show all mappings
- Does 'agent-business-groups.config' exist? Show the groupings
- Any other dual-view related configs added?

## 2. Database Changes
Check the following database modifications:
- Was 'view_mode' column added to user_preferences table? Show the schema
- Were business KPIs added to dashboard_kpis table? List them with values
- Any other database schema changes made?

## 3. Component Implementation
Verify these components exist and show their implementation:
- ViewModeToggle.tsx - Does it exist? Show the code
- BusinessKPISection.tsx - Does it exist? Show the code
- Any modifications to EnhancedDashboard.tsx? Show the changes
- Any modifications to UniversalDashboardMetrics.tsx? Show the changes
- Any modifications to AgentHierarchy.tsx? Show the changes
- Any modifications to AiCommandCenter.tsx? Show the changes

## 4. API Endpoints
Check for new endpoints:
- Does /api/config/user-view-mode endpoint exist? Show the implementation
- Any modifications to existing /api/kpis endpoint?
- Any new business metrics endpoints created?

## 5. Feature Flag Status
- Is the dual-view feature currently enabled or disabled?
- Which personas can see the toggle (if implemented)?
- Is there a rollback mechanism in place?

## 6. View Persistence
- How is the view mode preference stored (localStorage, database, or both)?
- Does switching views persist across sessions?
- Is the preference tied to the user account?

## 7. Business Metrics Display
If business view is implemented, show:
- Current business KPI values being displayed
- How technical metrics map to business terminology
- Any tooltips or overlays showing technical details in business view

## 8. Activity Tracking
- Are view mode changes being logged in the activities table?
- Show any recent activity logs related to view switching

## 9. Testing & Validation
- Have any test cases been written for dual-view functionality?
- Any console errors or warnings related to the new features?
- Is the technical view still working exactly as before?

## 10. Current Status Summary
Please provide:
- Which phases (1-5) have been completed?
- Any deviations from the original plan?
- Any issues encountered during implementation?
- What still needs to be implemented?

## 11. Live Functionality Check
- Can you switch between Technical and Business views right now?
- Take a screenshot if the toggle is visible
- What happens when you click the toggle (if it exists)?

## 12. Code Quality Check
- Are all new components following TypeScript patterns?
- Any use of 'any' types in new code?
- Are Universal component patterns being followed?
- ConfigService integration working properly?

Please provide specific code snippets, actual values, and current state for each item above. If something hasn't been implemented yet, explicitly state "NOT IMPLEMENTED" rather than skipping it.
