(with loading spinner), then "Here are the current Meta Brain performance metrics: CPU usage at 45%, response time at 200ms, task completion rate at 98%." Auto-closes after 5 seconds.
    - Response: Displayed in the popup as above.
    - Persistence: Store command, response, and agent details in the `commands` table (input, response, mode, persona, agent: "Data Analysis", timestamp).
