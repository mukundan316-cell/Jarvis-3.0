Based on Replit Agent's excellent progress (✅ Priority 1 and Priority 2 completed!), here's the next incremental prompt for **Priority 3**:

```
PRIORITY 3: FIX EMAIL PROCESSING DATA QUALITY - Following replit.md guidelines, resolve the email processing pipeline failure where 0 submissions are being created from 11 processed emails, causing data persistence issues in the email-to-submission conversion workflow.

Part 1: Question Deconstruction
UNDERSTAND: Email processing pipeline is failing to convert processed emails into database submissions
ANALYZE: 11 emails processed but 0 submissions created indicates conversion logic failure
REASON: Email intake is first step of Commercial Property workflow - must work for end-to-end functionality
SYNTHESIZE: Fix email-to-submission conversion with proper data persistence
CONCLUDE: Working email processing that creates valid submissions in database

Part 2: Email Processing Diagnosis Required

**IDENTIFY CONVERSION FAILURE POINT:**
- Emails are being received and processed (11 count confirms intake working)
- Conversion to submissions failing (0 submissions created)
- Determine where in the pipeline the failure occurs:
  - Email parsing and metadata extraction
  - Submission record creation
  - Database persistence
  - Validation and error handling

**VALIDATE EMAIL-TO-SUBMISSION FLOW:**
```typescript
Email Intake → Email Processing → Metadata Extraction → Submission Creation → Database Save
     ✅              ❌                    ?                      ?                  ?
```

**CHECK DATABASE OPERATIONS:**
- Verify email data is being saved to emails table
- Confirm submission creation logic attempts database insert
- Validate foreign key relationships between emails and submissions
- Check for validation errors preventing submission persistence

Part 3: Implementation Requirements

**DATABASE-DRIVEN CONVERSION:**
- Use existing email templates and parsing logic (no hard-coding)
- Leverage existing submissions table schema
- Maintain audit trail in activities table
- Ensure persona-based filtering works for email submissions

**EXPECTED OUTCOME:**
- Processed emails successfully create submission records
- Email-to-submission ratio improves from 0/11 to functional conversion
- Commercial Property workflow can be triggered from email intake
- Database persistence works end-to-end

Test the fix by processing a sample email and confirming a corresponding submission record appears in the database with proper foreign key relationships and audit trail.
