Looking through this extensive thread, let me verify I've captured all your end-to-end requirements for the agent lifecycle management system. I want to ensure nothing critical has been missed:

## Requirements Coverage Check

### ✅ **Core Requirements from Original Assessment**
1. **Agent Maturity Levels (L0-L4)** - Included in Phase 1
2. **Comprehensive Agent Taxonomy** - 8 agent types via ConfigService
3. **Version Control & Metadata** - Full versioning with rollback
4. **Governance & Compliance** - EU AI Act, risk levels, audit trails
5. **Performance Monitoring** - SLA, KPIs, health checks
6. **Enhanced Integration Architecture** - Data sources, security, orchestration
7. **Context & Memory Management** - Short/long-term, episodic, semantic
8. **Deployment & Scaling** - Cloud providers, auto-scaling, resources

### ✅ **Critical Gaps from Independent Review**
1. **Agent Retirement & Decommissioning** - Added retirement wizard with migration
2. **Testing & QA Framework** - Full test suite simulation
3. **Cost Management** - Real-time tracking with ROI calculations
4. **Continuous Learning Pipeline** - Learning metrics dashboard
5. **Disaster Recovery** - Failover demonstration with auto-recovery
6. **Dependency Management** - Interactive visualization graph
7. **Access Control** - Fine-grained permissions matrix
8. **Progressive Rollout** - A/B testing visualization

### ✅ **Platform-Specific Requirements**
1. **ConfigService-Driven** - All business logic in database
2. **Non-Breaking Changes** - Extensions only, no destructive alterations
3. **Lego Block Architecture** - Incremental, modular components
4. **Cross-Platform Consistency** - 5-minute TTL cache synchronization
5. **Universal Components** - Following existing patterns
6. **No Hard-Coding** - Everything database-configured

### ✅ **MDP-Specific Adjustments**
1. **Visual Impact Priority** - 6-tab modal, animations, graphs
2. **Demo Scenarios** - 5 key demonstration paths
3. **Mock Data Strategy** - Impressive metrics via ConfigService
4. **Rapid Implementation** - 2-week timeline vs 8-week production

### ⚠️ **Potential Gaps to Confirm**

**1. Multi-Persona Experience**
While I've included role-based access (Admin, Rachel, John, Broker), should the UI dynamically adjust based on persona? For example:
- Rachel sees underwriting-focused metrics
- John sees IT operations view
- Admin sees everything

**2. Real-Time WebSocket Integration**
Your existing platform has WebSocket monitoring. Should the lifecycle management features include:
- Live agent status updates
- Real-time cost accumulation
- Push notifications for test results

**3. Voice Integration**
Your platform has Web Speech API integration. Should we add:
- Voice commands for agent lifecycle operations
- "Hey JARVIS, rollback agent to version 2"

**4. 6-Layer Architecture Alignment**
Should the lifecycle features explicitly map to your layers:
- Experience → Meta Brain → Role → Process → System → Interface
- Different lifecycle rules per layer

**5. Insurance Domain Specifics**
Should we add insurance-specific lifecycle features:
- Regulatory compliance checkpoints
- Claims processing performance metrics
- Underwriting accuracy tracking

The plan covers approximately 95% of stated requirements. The main areas that might need clarification are the multi-persona UI adaptations and real-time integration depth. Would you like me to adjust the plan to explicitly address any of these potential gaps?
