PHASE 2: Enhanced Modal UI & Agent Testing Framework with Showcase Mode
CORE TASKS:
1. Read current CreateNewAgentModal.tsx and preserve all existing form functionality
2. Transform modal into 4-tab interface while keeping all current fields intact:
   - Tab 1: "Configuration" (all existing form content - NO CHANGES)
   - Tab 2: "Testing & QA" (new AgentTestingPanel component)
   - Tab 3: "Lifecycle" (new AgentLifecyclePanel component)  
   - Tab 4: "Version History" (new VersionHistoryPanel component, disabled for new agents)
3. Create new testing table in shared/schema.ts:
   - agent_test_results (id, agent_id, test_type, test_name, status, results, executed_at)
4. Build AgentTestingPanel component with:
   - Pre-configured test templates from ConfigService
   - Test execution interface
   - Results display with pass/fail indicators
   - Integration with existing agent types and layers
5. Build AgentLifecyclePanel component with:
   - Maturity level progression display
   - Dependency mapping interface
   - Retirement planning controls
   - Resource usage projections
6. Build VersionHistoryPanel component with:
   - Version timeline display
   - Configuration diff viewer
   - One-click rollback functionality
   - Change impact analysis
7. Extend UniversalExplainableAIGovernance Management tab:
   - Add "Agent Lifecycle Management" card to existing grid (change from 2 to 3 columns)
   - Display pending retirement agents
   - Show version conflicts requiring attention
   - Maintain existing Risk Assessment and Audit Trail cards
8. Add testing API endpoints to server/routes.ts:
   - POST /api/agents/:id/tests (execute test)
   - GET /api/agents/:id/tests (get test results)
   - GET /api/tests/templates (get test templates)
SHOWCASE MODE TASKS:
9. Enhance AgentTestingPanel with showcase mode:
   - When showcase enabled, show optimized test results alongside real results
   - Display "Current vs Potential" comparison views
   - Add learning curve projections showing testing improvement over time
   - Include AI-powered test optimization suggestions
10. Enhance AgentLifecyclePanel with showcase projections:
    - Show optimal lifecycle progression timelines
    - Display enhanced maturity advancement predictions
    - Include resource optimization projections
    - Add dependency optimization recommendations
11. Enhance VersionHistoryPanel with showcase insights:
    - Show version performance comparisons with enhancement overlays
    - Display configuration optimization suggestions
    - Include rollback impact analysis with enhanced outcomes
    - Add predictive version planning with showcase projections
12. Add showcase mode controls to modal:
    - Small toggle in modal header: "Show Potential" 
    - When enabled, all panels show enhanced data with clear visual differentiation
    - Include tooltip explaining showcase mode: "Showing optimized projections based on current data"
VALIDATION CRITERIA:
- Modal opens with existing "Configuration" tab showing all current fields
- New tabs are functional and properly integrated
- Testing framework can execute and display results
- Version history shows meaningful data for existing agents
- AI Governance Management tab includes lifecycle section without breaking existing layout
- All existing modal functionality preserved (agent creation/editing works exactly as before)
- All modal tabs respect showcase mode setting
- Enhanced projections in testing show realistic improvement potential
- Lifecycle projections demonstrate achievable optimization goals
- Visual distinction between real and enhanced data is clear
DELIVERABLES:
- Enhanced CreateNewAgentModal.tsx with 4-tab interface
- AgentTestingPanel, AgentLifecyclePanel, VersionHistoryPanel components
- Updated shared/schema.ts with agent_test_results table
- Extended UniversalExplainableAIGovernance.tsx Management tab
- Testing API endpoints in server/routes.ts
- ConfigService integration for test templates and lifecycle rules
- Complete showcase mode integration across all modal tabs
- Visual indicators and controls for showcase mode
