Here's a comprehensive documentation update prompt:

```
COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTATION UPDATE: Update all project documentation to reflect current JARVIS IntelliAgent 3.0 system status, removing outdated content while preserving critical development guidelines and architectural insights from replit.md.

Part 1: Question Deconstruction
UNDERSTAND: Update documentation to match actual working system capabilities and remove legacy/incorrect information
ANALYZE: Current docs contain outdated agent counts, broken workflow references, and incorrect setup procedures
REASON: Documentation should guide users to working features and accurate system understanding
SYNTHESIZE: Clean, accurate documentation reflecting enhanced UniversalAgentExecutionPopup framework and CP workflow capabilities
CONCLUDE: Streamlined documentation enabling successful system usage and development

Part 2: Current System Status (Document These Realities)

**WORKING FEATURES TO DOCUMENT:**
- Enhanced UniversalAgentExecutionPopup framework supporting interactive multi-step workflows
- Commercial Property workflow with 8 functional steps and real CRUD operations
- 116+ agent architecture with focus on 8-12 core CP agents for Rachel AUW persona
- Interactive form inputs, file uploads, and step-by-step data collection
- 6-layer hierarchical agent execution (Experience→Meta Brain→Role→Process→System→Interface)
- Database schema with workflow state management and step data persistence
- Real-time agent orchestration with appropriate agents per workflow step
- Multi-persona system (Admin, Rachel AUW, John IT) with working voice commands

**RESOLVED ISSUES TO REMOVE FROM DOCS:**
- References to "broken workflow steps" (CP workflow actually works)
- Incorrect agent counts (23/68 agents - now 68+ working agents)
- Separate workflow section complaints (being integrated into hierarchy)
- Scripted demo references (now interactive with real inputs)
- Duplicate component issues (consolidated into universal framework)

Part 3: Documentation Structure Optimization

**UPDATE THESE FILES:**

**README.md Enhancement:**
- Accurate system overview reflecting enhanced popup framework
- Current feature set with interactive CP workflow capabilities
- Updated technology stack and dependencies
- Remove outdated limitations and add current capabilities

**SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md Cleanup:**
- Verified setup steps that actually work with current system
- Updated agent count expectations (116+ total, 68+ for Rachel)
- Correct database schema setup including CP extensions
- Working environment variable configurations
- Remove references to non-functional features

**replit.md Enhancement (CRITICAL - PRESERVE THESE):**

### Development Meta-Prompt Guidelines (KEEP INTACT)
**MANDATORY RESPONSE PROTOCOL**
- UNDERSTAND: State the core requirement
- ANALYZE: List key factors, existing components to reuse
- REASON: Explain integration with current 6-layer architecture  
- SYNTHESIZE: Propose strategy that extends existing frameworks
- CONCLUDE: Choose optimal approach (extend vs create new)

**Architecture Integration Requirements**
- Reuse existing agents and frameworks rather than duplicating
- Integrate with current UniversalAgentExecutionPopup system
- Maintain existing persona-based access control
- Preserve 116-agent architecture integrity

**Implementation Standards**
- NO HARD-CODING: All business logic stored in database with effective dates
- TYPESCRIPT SAFETY: Fix errors before adding features
- MODULAR DESIGN: Create reusable "Lego block" components
- AUDIT TRAIL: Log all agent executions and user interactions
```

**NEW: ENHANCED_FRAMEWORK.md Creation:**
Document the enhanced UniversalAgentExecutionPopup framework:
- Interactive workflow step architecture
- Form input and validation patterns
- File upload and processing capabilities
- Agent integration per workflow step
- Database persistence patterns

Part 4: Architecture Documentation Updates

**6-LAYER AGENT ARCHITECTURE (Updated):**
- Experience Layer: Insurance company configuration
- Meta Brain Layer: Workflow routing and orchestration
- Role Layer: Persona-specific agents (Rachel, Admin, John)
- Process Layer: Workflow-specific agents (CP Email Intake, CP Risk Assessment, etc.)
- System Layer: Core processing agents (CP Data Enrichment, CP Database Manager)
- Interface Layer: UI and interaction agents (CP Upload Interface, CP Analytics Dashboard)

**COMMERCIAL PROPERTY WORKFLOW INTEGRATION:**
- 8 workflow steps integrated into 6-layer hierarchy
- Real form inputs and file uploads per step
- Step-specific agent execution within hierarchical view
- Database persistence of workflow state and step data
- Professional insurance industry interface

Part 5: Remove Legacy/Incorrect Content

**DELETE REFERENCES TO:**
- Non-working workflow steps or broken functionality
- Duplicate dashboard components (Dashboard.tsx vs EnhancedDashboard.tsx issues)
- Incorrect TypeScript error counts (was claiming 18 errors, actually much fewer)
- Hardcoded workflow detection (now dynamic and configurable)
- Missing database integrations (now functional with CRUD operations)
- Scripted demo limitations (now interactive with real data collection)

**PRESERVE CRITICAL INSIGHTS:**
- Development Meta-Prompt Guidelines from replit.md
- 6-layer agent architecture principles and benefits
- Persona-based access control patterns
- Database schema design lessons and extensions
- Security and compliance requirements for insurance industry
- Modular "Lego block" design principles
- Error handling and audit trail requirements

Part 6: API and Usage Documentation

**CREATE: API_REFERENCE.md**
Document working API endpoints:
- Commercial Property workflow endpoints
- Agent execution endpoints
- File upload and processing endpoints
- Database CRUD operations for workflow steps
- Authentication and session management

**CREATE: WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md**
Step-by-step guide for using enhanced framework:
