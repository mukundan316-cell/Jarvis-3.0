Conduct a comprehensive audit of current implementation status across all major components:

BROKER PERSONA & AUTHENTICATION:
1. Is Mike Stevens broker persona actually implemented and accessible?
2. Can you log in as Mike Stevens and access a broker-specific interface?
3. Does persona switching include broker option in the UI?
4. Are broker credentials properly configured in the authentication system?

DOCUMENT UPLOAD & EMAIL CREATION:
1. Is the CPEmailIntake component integrated into Mike Stevens' broker dashboard?
2. Can Mike actually upload ACORD forms, SOV files, and loss runs?
3. Does document upload create new email records in the database (not seed data)?
4. Are uploaded files properly stored as attachments in JSONB format?

4-AGENT PROCESSING PIPELINE:
1. Does the 4-agent pipeline process newly uploaded documents (not just seed data)?
2. Is OpenAI Vision API actually extracting data from uploaded ACORD forms?
3. Are real confidence scores being calculated and stored?
4. Does the pipeline complete successfully for new submissions?

HITL TASK GENERATION:
1. Do low confidence scores automatically create HITL tasks in the database?
2. Are these HITL tasks appearing in Rachel's morning briefing?
3. Is the HITL modal functional with real extracted data (not hardcoded)?
4. Does "Task Complete" button update workflow progression?

RACHEL'S MORNING BRIEFING:
1. Are new submissions from Mike Stevens appearing in Rachel's briefing?
2. Do HITL tasks show actual confidence percentages and submission details?
3. Can Rachel see real-time updates when Mike uploads new documents?

STEP 1 TO STEP 2 PROGRESSION:
1. After Step 1 completes, does Step 2 (Intelligent Ingestion) actually trigger?
2. Is the 8-step workflow progression functional beyond just Step 1?
3. Does the UniversalAgentExecutionPopup show proper 6-layer execution?

Provide specific test results: Try uploading a document as Mike Stevens and trace what actually happens versus what should happen.
